## Usage

```purescript
import Data.BinPacking

testBins :: Array Bin
testBins = [ { name: "Small bin"
              , dim: {x: 10, y: 15, z: 20}
              , maxWeight: 100
              }
            , { name: "Medium Bin"
              , dim: {x: 100, y: 150, z: 200}
              , maxWeight: 1000
              }
            ]

testItems :: Array Item
testItems = [ { name: "Item 1"
              , flatDim: {x: 2, y: 2, z: 1}
              , weight: 2
              }
            , { name: "Item 2"
              , flatDim: {x: 3, y: 3, z: 2}
              , weight: 3
              }
            ]

testPack :: Packed
testPack = pack testBins testItems
```

## Improvements

### Rewrite
This is an implementation of a fundamentally imperative algorithm. There might be better ways to express this problem in a more functional way.
This was also written by a novice in functional programming for fun.

### Tests
The codebase could be improved to allow more testing of seperate functions.

I originally intended using quickcheck, but it involved getting around orphan instances. As of writing this, `purescript-jack` is not part of the package set this project uses. 

### Reusability
I suspect there might be a simple way to make the types more polymorphic using open record types. In order to ensure the user that if they use an `Item UserItem` they will get `PositionedItem UserItem`.

`Bin` and `Item` records are augmented to `PackedBin` and `PositionedItem`, and not re-constructed, so they should be somewhat polymorphic.

### Expansion
This library currently uses only one heuristic.
It is based on the following paper and codebases:
* [Optimizing three-dimensional bin packing through simulation](erick_dube_507-034.pdf)
* https://github.com/bom-d-van/binpacking (Golang)
* https://github.com/gedex/bp3d (Golang)
* https://github.com/enzoruiz/3dbinpacking (Python)

Further heuristics and constraints could be considered.
For example, porting this 1D binpacking library https://hackage.haskell.org/package/Binpack or mixed integer programming solutions.
